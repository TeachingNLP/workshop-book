# Learning PyTorch Through A Neural Dependency Parsing Exercise

### Author
David Jurgens

### Abstract

Dependency parsing is increasingly the popular parsing formalism in practice. This assignment provides a practice exercise in implementing the shift-reduce dependency parser of Chen and Manning (2014). This parser is a two-layer feed-forward neural network, which students implement in PyTorch, providing practice in developing deep learning models and exposure to developing parser models.
