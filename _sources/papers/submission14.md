# On Writing a Textbook on Natural Language Processing

### Author 
Jacob Eisenstein

### Abstract
There are thousands of papers about natural language processing and computational linguistics, but very few textbooks. I describe the motivation and process for writing a college textbook on natural language processing, and offer advice and encouragement for readers who may be interested in writing a textbook of their own.
