### Abstract

In 2018, the Master Sc. in NLP opened at IDMC - Institut des Sciences du Digital, du Management et de la Cognition, Universit√© de Lorraine - Nancy, France. Far from being a creation ex-nihilo, it is the product of a history and many reflections on the field and its teaching. This article proposes epistemological and critical elements on the opening and maintainance of this so far new master's program in NLP.
