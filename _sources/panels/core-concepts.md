- **Day 1: June 10th from 12:00 to 13:00 UTC-04:00 or ET**
- **How to connect:** [Zoom via Underline](https://underline.io/events/122/sessions?eventSessionId=4302)
- **We would like to address some of your questions during the panel discussion. Please write your questions on this topic in this [Google document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZS8BhrAJHGa-RB5e8IHqSGsR6GAEpEXv552u9kZG1g0/edit#heading=h.6zc9ik4syd0b).**   

NLP is a rapidly growing field which brings unique challenges to the educators. Many of us grapple with at least some of the following questions.   

- How much time should we spend on classical NLP vs. deep learning NLP in an introductory NLP course?
- What's the role of linguistics in NLP courses today?
- What should be the prerequisites for introductory NLP courses? Should we presuppose supervised and unsupervised machine learning , deep learning, and some basic linguistics knowledge? 
- Most of the NLP courses teach different NLP models, NLP pipeline tasks, applications, evaluation, and tools. What is the most constructive way to weave these things together? 
- NLP is changing fast and the skills we teach today risk being outdated to the students in a matter of years. How do we prepare student for this constant change in the field? 
- How do we effectively teach ethical and responsible use of NLP models?
- What topics should we save for advanced NLP course?  

In this panel discussion we'll hear thoughts of our amazing panelists on some of the above questions.
