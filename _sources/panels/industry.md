Many, if not most, of the students in our NLP courses go on to industry in a variety of roles. These roles range from software developers, to data scientists, to full-time researchers, each with their own skills and responsibilities. What does industry need from us as educators to produce students that meet their needs? This panel brings together folks from a variety of industries to hear about their experiences with NLP technology and students. Panelists will be asked to share their thoughts on what types of skills they want to see, how NLP is used in different roles in their organizations, and what role do state-of-the-art methods and research play in their production environments. We also encourage questions from the audience.
