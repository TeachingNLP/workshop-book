## Why Teaching NLP workshop?

The field of natural language processing (NLP) is growing rapidly with emergence of new state-of-the-art methods almost every year. As educators in the field, we are faced to make many decisions as to _what_ to teach and _how_ to do it. The fast-paced nature of NLP and popularity of NLP in different disciplines bring some unique challenges for curriculum design:  

- What fundamental concepts should we be teaching future NLP researchers and practitioners? 
- What kinds of paths through courses should we provide for students traversing an NLP-related degree? 
- How should we tailor our courses for wider audiences (e.g., for students from social sciences, humanities, medicine, and statistics)? 
- How do we scale our teaching for larger class sizes while preserving the accessibility of complex material?
- How do we teach _resposible_ and _ethical_ use of NLP?

There have been [four Teaching NLP workshops](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/venues/teachingnlp/) in the past. The [last workshop](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W13-3400/) happened in 2013 co-located with ACL in Sofia, Bulgaria. The field has changed quite a bit in the last 8 years and it is definitely time for the next workshop in the series.  

## Goals

By the end of of the workshop we hope to achieve the following high level goals. 

- Encourage a dialogue and collaboration between NLP educators and researchers in academia and industry to address the questions above.  
- Identify and document challenges in teaching and learning NLP in different contexts.
- Provide a forum to share teaching and learning methodologies and tools in NLP education. 
- Compile resources for teaching and learning NLP  that can last beyond the discussions held during the workshop.
