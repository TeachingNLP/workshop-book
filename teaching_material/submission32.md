### Abstract

We provide an overview of a new Computational Text Analysis course that will be taught at Barnard College over a six week period in May and June 2021. The course is targeted to non Computer Science at a Liberal Arts college that wish to incorporate fundamental Natural Language Processing tools in their re- search and studies. During the course, students will complete daily programming tutorials, read and review contemporary research papers, and propose and develop independent research projects.
