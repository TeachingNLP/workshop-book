# What do we teach in NLP courses?

When we design NLP courses in different contexts, many of us struggle with at least some of the following points.   

- What models, tasks, topics, applications should we include or exclude from the course? For example, 
    - Should we spend a lecture on hidden Markov models?  
    - Should we include automatic speech recognition in the course? 
    - Is it OK to skip semantic parsing and syntactic parsing? 
- How do we balance theory vs practice? How much detail is appropriate in the given context? For example, 
    - Do we go into the math of Latent Dirichlet Allocation model for topic modeling? 
    - Or is it more useful to show different practical considerations when training an LDA model on a large real-world dataset using a library such as `Gensim` and interpreting the topics appropriately?    
    - Do we spend a full lecture on explaining the math and details of LSTMs or is this time better used if we show how do we train an LSTM using tools such as `PyTorch` and `TorchText` for text classification?  
- How do we imbibe _responsible_ and _ethical_ use of NLP in students?
